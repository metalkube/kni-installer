# Bare Metal IPI Bootstrap Assets

The `baremetal` platform (IPI for Bare Metal hosts) includes some additional
assets on the bootstrap node for automating some infrastructure requirements
that would have normally been handled by some cloud infrastructure service.
The [Bare Metal IPI Networking Infrastructure design
document](../../../../docs/design/baremetal/networking-infrastructure.md)
covers the high-level background, and this document explains these
bootstrap assets in more detail.

## API failover from bootstrap to control plane machines

`keepalived` is used to manage the failover of a VIP (Virtual IP) for the API
server. This VIP first resides on the bootstrap VM. Once the master nodes come
up, the VIP will move to the control plane machines.

Relevant files:
* **files/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf.tmpl** - `keepalived` configuration
  template
* **files/usr/local/bin/keepalived.sh** - This script runs before `keepalived`
  starts and generates the `keepalived` configuration file from the template.
* **systemd/units/keepalived.service** - systemd unit file for `keepalived`.
  This runs `keepalived.sh` to generate the proper configuration from the
  template and then runs podman to launch `keepalived`.
* **files/usr/local/bin/fletcher8** - Script that uses the
  [fletcher8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%27s_checksum) algorithm to
  generate a hash from an input string. This is used by `keepalived.sh` to
  generate a hash based on the cluster name to generate VRRP ids for
  use with Keepalived and to ensure those IDs do not clash with another cluster
  on the same network.
* **files/usr/local/bin/get_vip_subnet_cidr** - Script to determine the network
  CIDR for a given VIP.  This is used by `keepalived.sh` to determine which
  local interface is on the VIPâ€™s network.

## Internal DNS

The bootstrap assets relating to DNS automate as much of the DNS requirements
internal to the cluster as possible.

TODO - explain how this works ...
